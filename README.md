## Project: DEVchat Summary

```
A real-time chat web application built using node.JS, React-Redux, Websocket, MongoDB.
The aim of our project was to successfully develop the DEVchat platform, our unique take on a real-time chat room.
As computer science seniors, we are passionate about software development as well as problem-solving. This project served as a way for us to gain experience working on a mid-sized complex application, organizing teamwork, and exploring the use of all the technologies and tools weâ€™ve been exposed to in this class.
